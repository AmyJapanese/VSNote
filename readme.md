## Overview

VSNote brings the familiar look and feel of Visual Studio Code into Obsidian,  
combining the productivity of your favorite editor with the note-taking power of Obsidian.

### Features

- **VS Code-inspired color palette** for both Light and Dark modes.
- **Monospaced headings** for a developer-friendly look.
- **Active tab underline** just like VS Code‚Äôs tab bar.
- **VS Code-style status bar** spanning the entire bottom edge.
- Folder/file tree and icon tweaks to resemble the VS Code explorer.
- Accent color customization via `--interactive-accent`.

### Limitations
- Full reproduction of VS Code's square scrollbars is not possible due to Obsidian's reliance on native system scrollbars.  
- This theme provides similar colors and overall feel, but scrollbar appearance may vary depending on your operating system.

### Notes

- Accent color defaults to Obsidian‚Äôs standard purple.  
  If you want the **VS Code blue** look, change your accent color in **Settings ‚Üí Appearance ‚Üí Accent color**  
  and set the RGB values to:  
  - HEX: `#007acc`
  - RGB: (0, 122, 204)
- The theme is designed for Obsidian‚Äôs built-in theme installer (‚ÄúCommunity Themes‚Äù) ‚Äî  
  no manual installation instructions are provided here.
- Works best with the default Obsidian UI layout.  
  Some heavily customized plugin layouts may need additional CSS adjustments.

### Customization

This theme uses Obsidian's built-in accent color system.  
Scrollbar colors and highlights follow the accent color you select in **Settings ‚Üí Appearance ‚Üí Accent color**.  
Direct CSS editing is not required or recommended.
