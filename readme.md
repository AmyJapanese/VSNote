## Overview

VSCodian brings the familiar look and feel of Visual Studio Code into Obsidian,  
combining the productivity of your favorite editor with the note-taking power of Obsidian.

### Features

- **VS Code-inspired color palette** for both Light and Dark modes.
- **Monospaced headings** for a developer-friendly look.
- **Active tab underline** just like VS Code’s tab bar.
- **VS Code-style status bar** spanning the entire bottom edge.
- Folder/file tree and icon tweaks to resemble the VS Code explorer.
- Accent color customization via `--interactive-accent`.

### Notes

- Accent color defaults to Obsidian’s standard purple.  
  If you want the **VS Code blue** look, change your accent color in **Settings → Appearance → Accent color**  
  and set the RGB values to:  
  - HEX: `#007acc`
  - RGB: (0, 122, 204)
- The theme is designed for Obsidian’s built-in theme installer (“Community Themes”) —  
  no manual installation instructions are provided here.
- “VScodian” is derived from “VS Code” + the suffix “-ian”.
  It is not related to Obsidian or its official branding.
- Works best with the default Obsidian UI layout.  
  Some heavily customized plugin layouts may need additional CSS adjustments.

### Customization

You can easily tweak:

- **Accent color:** Edit the `--interactive-accent` variable in the theme CSS.
- **Heading font:** Change the `--vsc-heading-font` variable to any monospaced font you like.
- **Explorer icons:** Modify the folder/file icon rules in the CSS to match your taste.
